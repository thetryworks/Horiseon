# Horiseon

## Description:

This project was refactoring a landing page for a marketing company that specializes in SEO, online reputation management, and social media marketing. A lot of the code needed to be consolidated and did not match the mock up for the landing page. This was accomplished by trimming down redundant code and adding semantic div tags to make a more coherent set of code. Alt tags were also included to assist with accessibilty and google searches.

## Installation:
